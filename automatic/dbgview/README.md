DebugView is an application that lets you monitor debug output on your local system, or any computer on the network
that you can reach via TCP/IP. It is capable of displaying both kernel-mode and Win32 debug output, so you don't need
a debugger to catch the debug output your applications or device drivers generate, nor do you need to modify your
applications or drivers to use non-standard debug output APIs.
