    <description><![CDATA[

VMMap is a process virtual and physical memory analysis utility. It shows a breakdown of a process's committed virtual
memory types as well as the amount of physical memory (working set) assigned by the operating system to those types.
Besides graphical representations of memory usage, VMMap also shows summary information and a detailed process memory
map. Powerful filtering and refresh capabilities allow you to identify the sources of process memory usage and the
memory cost of application features.

Besides flexible views for analyzing live processes, VMMap supports the export of data in multiple forms, including a
native format that preserves all the information so that you can load back in. It also includes command-line options
that enable scripting scenarios.

VMMap is the ideal tool for developers wanting to understand and optimize their application's memory resource usage.
