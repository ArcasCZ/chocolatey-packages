BlueMaxima's Flashpoint is a webgame preservation project.

Internet history and culture is important, and content made on web platforms including, but not limited to Adobe Flash,
make up a significant portion of that culture. This project is dedicated to preserving as many experiences from these
platforms as possible, so that they aren't lost to time.

## Notes

* This is a meta-package which resolves to the preferred Flashpoint distribution.  This is currently the
