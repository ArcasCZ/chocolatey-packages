    <summary>The easiest way to explore and manipulate your MongoDB data</summary>
    <description><![CDATA[
    
The GUI for MongoDB. Visually explore your data. Run ad hoc queries in
seconds. Interact with your data with full CRUD functionality. View and
optimize your query performance. Compass empowers you to make smarter
decisions about indexing, document validation, and more.

## Features

### Vizualize and explore

Visualize, understand, and work with your data through an intuitive GUI.

### Insert, modify, and delete

Modify your data with a powerful visual editing tool.

### Debug and optimize

Understand performance issues with visual explain plans, view utilization
and manage your indices.

### Know your data with built-in schema visualization

MongoDB Compass analyzes your documents and displays rich structures within
your collections through an intuitive GUI. It allows you to quickly visualize
and explore your schema to understand the frequency, types and ranges of
fields in your data set.

### Get immediate insight into server status and query performance

Real-time server statistics let you view key server metrics and database
operations. Drill down into database operations easily and understand your
most active collections.

### Visualize, understand, and work with your geospatial data

Point and click to construct sophisticated queries, execute them with the
push of a button and Compass will display your results both graphically
and as sets of JSON documents.

### A better approach to CRUD makes it easier to interact with your data

Modify existing documents with greater confidence using the intuitive visual
editor, or insert new documents and clone or delete existing ones in just a
few clicks.

### Understand performance issues with visual explain plans

Know how queries are running through an easy-to-understand GUI that helps you
identify and resolve performance issues.

### View utilization and manage your indexes

Understand the type and size of your indexes, their utilization and special
properties. Add and remove indexes at the click of a button.

### A simpler way to validate your data

Write JSON Schema validation rules in an intelligent editor that auto-suggests
field names, BSON data types, and validation keywords. With a live preview of
documents that pass and fail the validation rule, it's easy to see whether the
rule has the desired behavior.

### Extensible via plugins

The Compass Plugin Framework is exposed as an API, making it extensible by users.
Looking for other functionality? Install a plugin or build your own.

### Aggregations made easy

Construct aggregation pipelines in an intuitive UI. Code skeletons and auto-complete
make it easy to build a stage, while a preview of documents shows you if the stage is
doing what you need. Add stages, remove them, or drag and drop to re-order in the
pipeline. Once you’re done, export it to native code to use in your application.
