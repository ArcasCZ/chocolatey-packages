[Sourcetrail](https://www.sourcetrail.com/) is a free and open-source cross-platform source explorer that helps you get productive on unfamiliar source code.

Software developers spend most of their time figuring out existing source code, but common code editing tools offer little help for this task. Debuggers only allow detailed inspection of one narrow code path. 'Find all references' helps you in navigating between files, but doesn't provide the context to see the big picture of all relevant dependencies. Sourcetrail provides both overview and details by combining an interactive dependency graph, a concise code view and efficient code search, all built into an easy-to-use cross-platform developer tool. It supports you in exploring legacy code, understanding the implementation and refactoring the software architecture, making it a fun experience for the whole family!
