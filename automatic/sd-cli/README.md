`sd` is an intuitive find and replace CLI.

## Features

* Painless regular expressions - `sd` uses regex syntax that you already know from JavaScript and Python. Forget about dealing with quirks of `sed` or `awk` - get productive immediately.
* String-literal mode - Non-regex find & replace. No more backslashes or remembering which characters are special and need to be escaped.
* Easy to read, easy to write - Find & replace expressions are split up, which makes them easy to read and write. No more messing with unclosed and escaped slashes.
* Smart, common-sense defaults - Defaults follow common sense and are tailored for typical daily use.
