## Notes

* The installer is a combined installer containing both 32 and 64-bit versions but it is not possible to specify which to install on a 64-bit
  system.  The installer will always use the version of the application matching the bitness of the OS.
* This package is automatically updated using the [Chocolatey Automatic Package Update Model (AU)](https://github.com/majkinetor/au/blob/master/README.md).
  If you find it is out of date by more than a day or two, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.
