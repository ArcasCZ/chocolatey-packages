WinObj is a must-have tool if you are a system administrator concerned about security, a developer tracking down
object-related problems, or just curious about the Object Manager namespace.

WinObj is a 32-bit Windows NT program that uses the native Windows NT API (provided by NTDLL.DLL) to access and display
information on the NT Object Manager's name space. Winobj may seem similar to the Microsoft SDK's program of the same
name, but the SDK version suffers from numerous significant bugs that prevent it from displaying accurate information
(e.g. its handle and reference counting information are totally broken). In addition, our WinObj understands many more
object types. Finally, Version 2.0 of our WinObj has user-interface enhancements, knows how to open device objects, and
will let you view and change object security information using native NT security editors.
