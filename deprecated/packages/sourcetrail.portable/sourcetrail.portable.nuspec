    <description><![CDATA[
[Sourcetrail](https://www.sourcetrail.com/) is a free and open-source cross-platform source explorer that helps you get productive on unfamiliar source code.

Software developers spend most of their time figuring out existing source code, but common code editing tools offer little help for this task. Debuggers only allow detailed inspection of one narrow code path. 'Find all references' helps you in navigating between files, but doesn't provide the context to see the big picture of all relevant dependencies. Sourcetrail provides both overview and details by combining an interactive dependency graph, a concise code view and efficient code search, all built into an easy-to-use cross-platform developer tool. It supports you in exploring legacy code, understanding the implementation and refactoring the software architecture, making it a fun experience for the whole family!

## Features

* Index source code
* Find any symbol
* Explore dependencies visually
* Browse source code
* Connect to your source editor
* SDK [SourcetrailDB](https://github.com/CoatiSoftware/SourcetrailDB) to write custom language extensions

## Notes

* Sourcetrail requires a number of configuration files to successfully operate with these configuration files being initially generated at runtime and persisted to local storage
* It it currently not possible to specify the location of the configuration files - these files are stored in the  in the `user` directory beneath the install location
* To ensure that these configuration files are writeable and the application can be run by any user without special priviledges the application binaries are installed in the `$env:ChocolateyToolsLocation` as determined by the `Get-ToolsLocation` function
* While the portable install is usable by any user it should be noted that the configuration files are shared globally
* This package is automatically updated using the [Chocolatey Automatic Package Update Model (AU)](https://github.com/majkinetor/au/blob/master/README.md).
  If you find it is out of date by more than a day or two, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.
