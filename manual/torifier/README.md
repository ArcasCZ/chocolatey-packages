Torifier lets you tunnel software applications through Tor without the need to reconfigure them. An application is not
required to have native proxy support in order to work with Torifier. Torifier is a Tor bundle, meaning the program
will install the Tor software and will manage it for you.

## Features

* Torify any application
* Intuitive graphical user interface
* Flexible firewall-bypass options
* Change your visible IP address with a single click
* Route DNS requests through Tor
* Automatically block UDP requests
* Optionally, torify all programs
* Emulate system-wide support for .onion names
